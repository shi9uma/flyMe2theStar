1. Self-entertainment: No engineering value, the majority is stitched together by copying others' code everywhere. Even if it's on GitHub, it won't receive any stars and might close down.
2. Repeating the same old tune: Spending a lot of time implementing code snippets that have been done countless times, with code reuse and organization skills approaching zero.
3. Abandon halfway: Rocket science for ideal features, screw tightening for the actual code kernel. The entire project only has a README written and last update was two years ago.
4. Basin recycling: Using various modern languages, such as Python, to replace code written in other languages with one's own.
5. Occult blessing: God knows why it runs, but after refactoring, there will definitely be issues.

[Neo](https://linux.do/t/topic/1051):

Some members of the group suggest that I should charge a reasonable fee to maintain this project.

Yes, from the beginning until now, this project has had no charges, no commercial collaborations, and no advertisements.

It's not that it can't be charged, not that no one has approached me for commercial collaboration, and not that there are no ads to display.

Regarding fees, I've mentioned in the group that the majority of netizens are caught between the GFW and OpenAI, and the cost is already high. I don't want to take advantage of the situation to cut deeper. As for commercial collaboration, my personal resources are limited, and after serving the business, I will inevitably struggle to allocate time to serve netizens. As for ads, I personally don't like them.

The Annotated STL Sourcesï¼š

The concept of open source originated from the American, Richard Stallman, who believed that hoarding source code is a morally reprehensible act. He argued that sharing source code with others allows them to learn and contribute back to the original creators. While locking down the source code may to some extent safeguard the "wealth that intelligence might generate", it hinders users from opportunities to learn and correct errors. Stallman left the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1984 and founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF). He penned the renowned GNU Manifesto, initiating the open reform project known as GNU.

Pronounced as "guh-noo" in Chinese according to GNU, it can be translated as "liberate" in the sense of breaking free from the fate of being enslaved, carrying both phonetic and semantic significance.
